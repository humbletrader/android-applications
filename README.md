Here's a list of all of my installed apps with descriptions.
by U, reddit.com

I was bored and figured I'd make a list of all of my installed apps which also acts as a list of recommendations, because, well.. I obviously really like all of these apps... And I hope you do/will, too !

ActionDash - Detailed app usage stats

AppsFree - List of paid apps that are temporarily 100% free

AutomaTag - Automatic ID3 music tag & cover editor

Better Open With - "Created to mimic Android's default "Complete action using" dialog, Better Open With shows you a visually similar popup screen when you choose to open a link, image, PDF or any other filetype - listing all possible app handlers as you normally see."

BookmarkFolder - Great bookmark manager

Bouncer - App permissions manager

Buttons remapper - Customize actions for physical buttons & remap keys (no root)

Simple Calendar - Self-explanatory

ColorNote - Lightweight notepad app with checklists, widgets, sync, etc.

Elixir - Old, but very powerful system information app with highly customizable widgets - I have two rows of custom shortcuts in my notification bar at all times. Please, check this app out if you haven't already

Empty Folder Cleaner - Quickly deletes all empty folders on your device

F-Droid - Alternative app store consisting entirely of FOSS apps

Face Slim - Lightweight (around 2mb, I think?) wrapper of Facebook website - allows messaging, too (on F-Droid)

Simple Gallery - Excellent feature-filled photo gallery

Google Opinion Rewards - Get paid to answer short surveys from time to time (never longer than 30 seconds, money goes directly to your Play Store account balance)

hovernote - Floating notepad

I Can't Wake Up! - By far the most customizable alarm clock app I've ever found - free version comes with all features with bottom banner ads

Linebit Icon Pack - Just an icon pack that I like

List My Apps - Does just what the name implies... Used to make this list

Lyrics Jaeger - Simple lyrics app

Maps Go - Lightweight alternative to the full Google Maps app that basically just uses Maps website on Chrome

MiXplorer - Excellent file manager app, lightweight & feature-packed

Moovit - Another good app I use for public transportation routes

Musicolet - Awesome music player - lightweight, nice UI, plenty of features & customization options, and it's 100% free & ad-free

My Location - Address Translator, Map & Widget - Save locations/favorite places & use the widget to quickly view & share your current location

Native Clipboard - Clipboard app

NewPipe - Amazing app. Lightweight YouTube alternative that allows you to play music in the background, floating video player, allows downloading of audio and/or video, etc. (on F-Droid)

Nova Launcher Prime - Most of you probably already know why this launcher gets the praise that it does - because it kicks ass

Pencerahan - Cool little app which launches a popup for controlling the brightness of the screen

Photo Editor (by dev.macgyver) - Just a great lightweight photo editor with plenty of editing tools

Popup Widget - Creates shortcuts to widgets - the widget will appear by tapping the shortcut. Lots of customization options, saves a lot of space (and probably battery life..?). Very useful app

Reminder Pro - Good app for notification bar reminders

Screen Master - Great app for taking screenshots - allows for simple editing, stitch/scrolling screenshots for entire web pages, etc.

Screenshot Tile (NoRoot) - A quick settings tile that, when pressed, takes a quick screenshot

SD Maid Pro - Probably the only cleaning app that actually does what it says - no BS or placebo functions that most "cleaning & boosting" apps have

Sesame Shortcuts - Excellent app that allows you to quickly search your device for just about anything - files, apps, search queries, etc. Plenty of options & custom shortcuts you can set up, too. Works great with Nova Launcher

Smarto Fast Uninstaller - Best batch uninstaller I've come across - lightweight, quick, free & ad-free

SwiftKey Beta - Great keyboard with the best prediction of them all in my experience, by far

Sync for Reddit Pro - My favorite Reddit app, with Joey being a close second

Tiles - Lots of quick settings tiles, very useful app

Timbre - App for editing audio & video files - cut, convert, join, etc.

True Phone - Highly customizable dialer & contacts app

Universal Copy - Copy text from any application, 100% free & ad-free. Very useful app

Via Browser - My alt. browser. Super lightweight (<1mb), fast & has a good amount of options

VolumePie - "VolumePie allows users to disable the default popup to change volume media on the top of the screen in favor of a side popup"

Wallpaper Modder - Good, simple app for editing & saving your wallpaper(s)

Weather Timeline (v12.3) - Great weather app that is no longer on the Play Store, but you can just find the apk & install it that way. **I use v12.3 because it was suggested that I do, although I honestly don't remember the reason(s).. but yeah, works great for me

Wikipedia Beta - Wikipedia app

YAATA - My personal favorite SMS app - probably more customization options than any other. I was a Textra user for years, and while I still think that's an excellent app, it has been replaced as my #1 SMS by this one..!

Yuzu Browser - My main browser. By now I'm sure you know I love customization - the more options, the better. It's lightweight, pretty fast & it is by far and without a doubt the most customizable browser available. In fact, it's probably one of the most customizable apps available in any category.
